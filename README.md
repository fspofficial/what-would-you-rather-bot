## What is this Bot? üëÄ
What You Would Rather? is a Guessing game where you guess one thing.
Long Description short Take this example:

You typed `r!rather` or `r!rth` in short, The bot ask you to Pick one thing from it

> You : r!rather

> Bot : What would you Rather?

> 1. 1930 - 2010s Cartoons

> 2. 2010 - 4020s Cartoons

Now you have to chose one option by typing `r!opt1` for Option 1 and `r!opt2` for Option 2
I have chosen Option 2 So i will type `r!opt1`

> You : `r!opt1`

> Bot : Nice, You have chosen Option 1

## Selfhosting the bot üòã
### Create a Discord Bot Account
1. Make sure you‚Äôre logged on to the [Discord website](https://discord.com/).
2. Navigate to the [application page](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
3. Click on the ‚ÄúNew Application‚Äù button.
4. Give the application a name and click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù.
5. Go to the ‚ÄúBot‚Äù tab and then click ‚ÄúAdd Bot‚Äù. You will have to confirm by clicking "Yes, do it!"

Keep the default settings for **Public Bot** (checked) and **Require OAuth2 Code Grant** (unchecked).
Your bot has been created. The next step is to copy the token.

**Note:** This token is your bot's password so don't share it with anybody. It could allow someone to log in to your bot and do all sorts of bad things. You can regenerate the token if it accidentally gets shared.

### Invite Your Bot to Join a Server
Now you have to get your Bot User into a server. To do this, you should create an invite URL for it.

1. Go to the "OAuth2" tab. Then select "bot" under the "scopes" section.
2. Now choose the permissions you want for the bot. Our bot is going to mainly use text messages so we don't need a lot of the permissions. You may need more depending on what you want your bot to do. Be careful with the "Administrator" permission.
3. After selecting the appropriate permissions, click the 'copy' button above the permissions. That will copy a URL which can be used to add the bot to a server.
4. Paste the URL into your browser, choose a server to invite the bot to, and click ‚ÄúAuthorize‚Äù.

To add the bot, your account needs "Manage Server" permissions.

### Hosting the Bot using Repl.it
